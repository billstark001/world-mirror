# Enum dropdown manual test checklist

Run this checklist on Minecraft 1.21.11, 26.1.2, 26.2, and 26.3.

## Global settings

1. Open Mod Menu, then World Mirror settings.
2. Check Save Location, Download Pipeline, Conflict Strategy, all three New Mirror settings,
   Chunk Map > Map Background, and all three Lifecycle Behaviour fields.
3. For each field, click once and verify every valid translated choice is visible, the current
   value is highlighted, the control cannot be typed into, and selecting a value closes the list.
4. Repeat inside collapsed sections near the top and bottom of the viewport. Verify the list is
   drawn above neighbouring entries, remains focused, and scrolls with normal Cloth Config input.
5. Verify keyboard/controller focus opens the list, moves through choices, selects a choice, and
   Escape or moving focus away closes it without changing the pending value.
6. Select the already-current value and verify the list still closes. Reopen and close each field
   repeatedly to check for stale focus or an accidental selection.
7. Use a narrow GUI scale and the longest translated labels. Verify closed labels end in one
   ellipsis when needed, preserve room for the arrow, and never show a caret or white cursor block.
8. Move keyboard focus across several closed fields without opening them: every arrow must remain
   downward. Only the one field with a visible open list may show an upward arrow.
9. Change only one dropdown value and verify Done becomes enabled immediately. Verify Cancel
   discards edits, Done saves edits, and Reset restores defaults.
10. Inspect `config/worldmirror.json` and confirm enum values still use uppercase names such as
   `DOWNLOADED`, `STABLE_PERIODIC`, and `KEEP`.

## Per-world settings

1. Open World Mirror Status > Settings in a source world.
2. Open Save Location and Conflict Strategy. Verify the full translated list appears over the
   surrounding controls, is compact and aligned to the value side, the current value has a marker,
   and no cycling or typing is required.
3. Verify mouse selection, keyboard/controller focus and activation, outside click, focus loss,
   and Escape all close the list without leaving disabled controls behind.
4. Verify choosing the current value closes the list as a no-op; changing Save Location still
   shows the move confirmation when a mirror exists; changing Conflict Strategy persists after
   reopening.
