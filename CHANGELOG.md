## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added

- Fabric builds for Minecraft `1.21.11`, `26.1.2`, and `26.2` from one shared source layout.
- Optional integration with Xaero World Map Bridge `0.1.0`, including World Mirror chunk-status rendering on Xaero's fullscreen map without embedding the bridge in World Mirror's jar.
- `scripts/build-modrinth.ps1` builds all Fabric targets and collects the three current-version distributable JARs in `build/modrinth`.
- Per-world mirror-location migration with confirmation, synchronized path remapping, and safeguards that require downloads and exports to stop first.
- A vanilla-readable `worldmirror_environment` data pack embedded in each mirror save, with featureless per-dimension biomes for uncaptured void terrain.
- Read-only detection of the currently-open local mirror save, including its schema compatibility and original source identity.
- Enter-before-load schema updates for outdated local mirror saves, with a targeted backup, native confirmation, progress, and completion feedback.
- Metadata lineage choices for Nearby Export made from an open mirror: inherit the original source, point at the current mirror, or create an independent snapshot.

### Changed

- Migrated the Java package namespace to `io.github.billstark001.worldmirror`.
- Replaced LibGui/Cotton status UI with native Minecraft screens while retaining source, mirror location, download/export state, per-world settings, and conflict-management views.
- The built-in map and Xaero overlay now use asynchronous status snapshots, viewport aggregation, and merged state-coloured boundaries.
- Compact status layout: source/type with mirror and cache count with last-sync time share rows; output and Xaero-bridge status are in the per-world settings tab.

### Fixed

- Status-screen text now uses opaque ARGB colours on the new GUI extraction API.
- Avoided forced immediate screen rendering when opening the status UI, eliminating the opening black flash.
- Restored state-coloured chunk boundaries on built-in and Xaero map overlays.
- Completed four-locale UI coverage for status ages, migration feedback, nearby-export messages, and chunk-map tooltips.
- Migrated existing mirrors from the flat `the_void` generator before exporting more chunks, preserving exported chunk palettes while restoring normal Overworld, Nether, and End climate baselines for uncaptured space.
- Kept data-pack asset revisions separate from the semantic world-generation schema so Minecraft command/data-pack format changes can refresh assets without redefining the migration contract.
- Added metadata to new Nearby Export saves and made the status map use a currently-open mirror save's own capture database; Xaero shows a yellow current-mirror indicator where its canvas API permits.
- Prevented an older mod from overwriting a mirror's newer worldgen schema or embedded-asset revision.
- Replaced silent download-time schema migration with explicit confirmation; current mirror saves are only warned about capture when Download is clicked, not when entered.
- Replaced Xaero's obscured yellow dot with a high-contrast `WM` UI badge beside its settings button and a one-time explanatory toast.
- Deferred the World Mirror schema prompt until Minecraft's own save-version upgrade has completed, and restored the world list correctly when that prompt is cancelled.
- Refreshed migrated metadata with the currently loaded mod version and repaired generated data-pack metadata for Minecraft's required `min_format` / `max_format` range.
- Added a one-time, backed-up cleanup for blank legacy `minecraft:the_void` chunks so they regenerate under schema 1 without deleting captured or player-modified terrain.
- Stopped schema migration from writing Minecraft's exclusively locked `session.lock` file.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Version bump: `0.2.2` → `0.2.3`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Xaero's World Map overlay mixin for Xaero's World Map `1.41.1` on
  Minecraft `26.2` by updating the exact injection anchor to the current
  `MapElementRenderHandler.render(...)` signature.
- Added a configurable Xaero overlay injection mode. `Exact Only` preserves the
  verified draw order, while `Tail Fallback` can keep the overlay available on
  unverified Xaero builds at the cost of drawing above Xaero map UI elements.
- Added runtime Xaero overlay capability status and non-fatal handling so
  unsupported Xaero builds no longer crash the client at startup.
- Consolidated Xaero exact and tail fallback injections into one guarded mixin
  class so multiple exact anchors can be added without duplicate overlay draws.
- Extended `scripts/Get-LatestXaerosWorldMap.ps1` with release listing, specific
  Xaero version selection, and automated `GuiMap` disassembly output for future
  injection-point maintenance.
- Fixed Xaero jar reuse when the selected version already exists as
  `.jar.disabled`, avoiding unnecessary repeated downloads.
- Changed `scripts/Switch-WorldMirrorBranch.ps1` so it no longer deletes
  `build/libs` by default; full build cleanup and Xaero disassembly-cache cleanup
  now require explicit switches.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Xaero's World Map Overlay:** Render World Mirror status fills and merged boundaries directly on Xaero's World Map screen.
- Added a PowerShell script helper `Get-LatestXaerosWorldMap.ps1` for downloading the latest Xaero's World Map jar for development/testing.
- Customizable Xaero overlay settings: toggle overlay, configure overlay refresh rate, and maximum visible cells limit.

### Changed

- Version bump: `0.2.1` → `0.2.2`.
- Updated the Minecraft/Fabric dependency set to `26.2`, Fabric Loader `0.19.3`,
  Fabric API `0.152.2+26.2`, ModMenu `20.0.0-beta.3`,
  and Cloth Config `26.2.155`.
- Reduced routine lifecycle, capture, export, migration, and world-structure logs from
  info to debug so normal gameplay chat/log output is quieter.
- Removed obsolete chest/debug mixins and centralized block-entity/container NBT handling
  in `BlockEntityNbtSupport`.
- **Chunk Map Optimizations:** Introduced `ChunkStatusCache` and `ChunkStatusSnapshot` to cache status data, reducing rendering and database query overhead on both the built-in chunk map and Xaero's overlay.
- Added merged boundary segment rendering to the built-in chunk map, reducing drawing calls when zoomed out.
- Extracted SQLite native drivers isolation for stable read-only status loading.

### Fixed

- Container block entities are no longer overwritten with empty `Items` data when a
  chunk is recaptured or exported over an existing local chunk. Previously captured or
  locally written non-empty item lists are preserved when the latest client-side block
  entity snapshot is empty.
- Container overlays are snapshotted when an export is deferred or running in the
  background, preventing later cache cleanup from dropping item data before the writer
  reaches the chunk.
- Default container titles such as `container.chest` and `container.chestDouble` are no
  longer written as `CustomName`, and old default-name compounds are stripped when chunks
  are merged.
- Double chest item ordering now follows vanilla's `ChestType.RIGHT == FIRST` combiner
  order for both full inventory packets and later single-slot updates, preventing large
  chest halves from being swapped or partially written.
- Chunk serialization now uses Minecraft's `SerializableChunkData` path, preserving
  available section light data (`BlockLight` / `SkyLight`), blending data, retrogen,
  post-processing, filtered heightmaps, and other vanilla chunk serialization fields
  that the client currently has.
- The download toggle keybinding now uses the `P` keysym instead of a raw scancode.
- Ported 26.2 client API usages for screen switching, HUD-hidden checks, and flat
  world preset lookup.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Chunk Map (Window 1):** Full-screen draggable grid map accessible from the status screen
  (Conflicts tab → Open Chunk Map).  Each cell is color-coded:
  - Transparent — never downloaded.
  - Green → Blue (logarithmic, based on age) — downloaded via `world_mirror`.
  - Orange — written by a third-party source (e.g. `player`, `map_hp`).
  - Red inset border — chunk has an unresolved conflict stored on disk.
  Hovering shows a tooltip with chunk coordinates, last-update time, and source.
  Clicking a conflicted chunk opens a per-chunk dialog: **Overwrite** / **Discard** / **Cancel**.
- **File-based conflict storage:** When the `Manual` conflict strategy is active, incoming
  server chunks that collide with existing local chunks are now written to
  `conflict_chunks/<dim>/r.X.Z.mca` inside the mirror-world folder (MCA format) rather than
  being lost on restart.
- **Conflicts tab — bulk resolution:** *Overwrite All* (apply all stored server chunks) and
  *Discard All* (delete all stored server chunks, keep local) buttons in the status screen.
- **Export Nearby Region (Feature 2.1):** New screen (Status tab → Export Nearby Region…)
  lets you choose a world name and radius (1–50 chunks) to snapshot all loaded chunks in
  that area into a fresh singleplayer save.  Spawn point is set to the player's current
  block position.
- **Direct Chunk Map keybinding:** Press **M** to open the chunk map without going through
  the status screen.  The binding is configurable in *Options → Controls → World Mirror*.
- **Chunk map settings:** Added configurable sparse-render threshold (4–16, default 8)
  and map background style (black or transparent, default black).
- **MCA write support:** Added shared per-file locking and same-directory temporary-file
  replacement for terrain, entity, and conflict MCA writes.
- Language file additions for all new UI strings (en_us, zh_cn, zh_tw, ja_jp).

### Changed

- Status screen Conflicts tab redesigned: shows stored-conflict count instead of in-memory
  queue, with Overwrite All / Discard All / Open Chunk Map buttons.
- Status screen Status tab: added *Export Nearby Region…* button.
- Dimension and server-world transition detection logs now use debug level instead of
  info level.
- Chunk map rendering switches to sparse drawing when zoomed far out, avoiding full-grid
  per-cell drawing at tiny cell sizes.
- Background exports are no longer daemon threads, reducing the chance of JVM shutdown
  cutting off an in-progress save write.

### Fixed

- CI/CD: Added `-Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false` JVM argument to `gradle.properties` to fix
  TLS SNI handshake failures with `server.bbkr.space` in the GitHub Actions environment.
- Export requests made while another export is running are queued and coalesced instead of
  being dropped.
- Chunks are only marked written after their region file has been flushed successfully, so
  failed region writes stay cached for a later retry.
- Region and conflict writes now share per-file locks, reducing races between normal export,
  manual conflict storage, and conflict resolution.
- Bulk conflict overwrite now maps legacy conflict folders (`region`, `DIM-1`, `DIM1`) back
  to the mod's current per-dimension world folder layout.
- Cleaned up several definite IDE warnings in mod-owned code without changing mixin method
  signatures or Minecraft mapping-sensitive casts.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- Container items now export correctly.
- Redstone components and other stateful blocks now export with their correct state.
- Biome and light data are now included correctly in chunk exports.
- Performance and memory issues in the caching and serialization processes have been comprehensively addressed:
  - Reduced blocking of the rendering/game threads caused by large-scale block capture before export, preventing noticeable stuttering caused by synchronous serialization.
  - Fixed an issue where container caches were not cleaned up synchronously when blocks expired, and modified the storage to be isolated by dimension to reduce memory growth after prolonged operation.
  - Cleaned up entity data that was out of sync with the block cache to prevent the continuous accumulation of entity cache data after dimension switching or frequent exports.
  - Tightened concurrent access paths for mirror mapping configurations to reduce the risk of race conditions between background exports and foreground configuration reads/writes.

### Added

- **SQLite chunk database** (`data/world_mirror.sqlite` inside each mirror world folder).
  Replaces the `chunkUpdateTimes` field in `worldmirror_meta.json` for chunk dirty-tracking.  The database also introduces an `update_sources` priority table that lets World Mirror and third-party tools (map renderers, importers) coexist without overwriting each other's data.  See `DATABASE.md` for the schema and integration guide.

- **Automatic migration** of legacy `chunkUpdateTimes` data from `worldmirror_meta.json` to SQLite on the first export after upgrading.  The JSON field is removed from the file after migration.

- **GitHub Actions release workflows** (manual trigger):
  - `release-modrinth.yml` — builds and publishes to Modrinth.
  - `release-github.yml` — builds and creates a GitHub Release with bundled JAR.

- **`DATABASE.md`** — English documentation for the SQLite schema, intended for third-party tool authors.

### Changed

- Version bump: `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`.
